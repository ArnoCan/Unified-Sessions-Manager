   10.1 NAMESERVICE-BASE
   =====================

    The nameservice utilities manage and provide mapping of ctys-names
    for VM-Addressing to TCP/IP addrsses.

    The following restrictions should be recognized first of all. 

     -> The ctys toolset handles by TCP/IP or better by OpenSSH
        interconnected entities. Thus HostOnly networks are not
        supported.

     -> The VMs like Xen and VMware rely as one of their most important
        identifier th MAC-Id, particularly when DHCP is used in higly
        dynamic networks, where the VMs are frequently roaming devices.

     -> ctys does handle DHCP based mapping, but does not support
        address-pools. So static administered MAC-addresses could be used
        for selection by ctys tools only. Anyhow, as long as this is not
        required, ctys perfectly cooporates with dynamically assigne
        TCP/IP-addresses.
