   ============================


    12.7.1. ERRORS-OBSTRUCTIVE
    ==========================

     Here are the most obstructive errors, which are frequently
     accumulated errors of some tools and the workaround.

      - VMware-WS-6.0.1:
        Description:
          When selecting "Show tray icon..." and "...machines in
          background after close."

          this seems to be meaning:
            Continue decoupled execution of a VM when WS-Front-End
            is closed, BUT reconnect JUST by context menu of 
            "tray-icon".

        Effect:
          1. Starting terminal "containing" ssh-client hangs when
             closing.
          2. Another call so ssh "ssh -X -f host01 vmware" does not
             function, but the context menu of "tray-icon" does.

        Solution:
          Do not use "tray-icon".

    12.7.1. ERRORS-REMINDER
    =======================

      - geometry: negative values
        Are not supported yet. Minor detail normally, thus 
        the layout-origin is by default (0,0) in
        upper-left-position. Currently almost any practically 
        relevant task could be managed. 

      - geometry: maximum values
        Currently not checked.
