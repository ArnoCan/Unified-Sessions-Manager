  ctys-genmconf
  
  
Usage:
  
  
  
  ctys-genmconf <options> [<execution-target-list>]
  
  
  
Description:
  
  ctys-genmconf  generates the initial conogura-
  
  tion entry for a PM or VM, which is stored as
  
  
       "/etc/ctys.d/[pv]m.conf".
  
  
  
  The output is either written to stdout only or duplicated into the pre-
  
  viously mentioned ole.
  
  
  
  The content of this ole is required by the VMSTACK feature (refer to
  
  Section ?? s:StacksAsVerticalSubgroups s:StacksAsVerticalSubgroups )
  
  during validation of static consistency and dynamic applicability of the
  
  stack members. This is particularly required for hidden oles in case of
  
  nested VMs to be started, where this data is required to be cached for
  
  pre-access within cacheDB. Several additional approaches are available,
  
  but this is the most versatile concept, even though it requires some pre-
  
  caching eoeorts.
  
  
  
  The current version supports one context only, thus for each change
  
  of the booted kernel the dioeerences could require a new generation of
  
  the conoguration ole, including the update of the cacheDB. Future ver-
  
  sions are going to support multiple boot-contexts for each PM and VM,
  
  which will include the decision for booting the appropriate kernel as de-
  
  cided by the foreseen load-balancing mechanism.
  
  
  
  The utility could be performed locally or remotely by full support of
  
  remote ctys-addressing.
  
  
  
  The generation of data requires root access for some tools. Namely the
  
  utility "dmiencode", which is used to evaluate the UUID of the machine
  
  requires for execution root-permissions. Anyhow, some older machines
  
  may not have a readable UUID at all.
  
  
  
  The utility should therefore be executed once on each participating PM
  
  and VM by the administrator during installation, and should be com-
  
  pleted manually with additional data.
  
  
  
  Preferably the rpm package should be installed during initial installa-
  
  tion phase, which will generate the appropriate conoguration entries.
  
  
  
  The data from the pm.conf will be required for the ctys-vhost utility
  
  and is therefore fetched by the ctys-vdbgen utility and is evaluated by
  
  ctys-dnsutil for dynamic decision of node type.
  
  
  
Options:
  
  
  
   -h
  
       Show help.
  
  
   -I <TCP-address>
  
       Preset value.
  
  
   -k  <ctys-vhost-search-key>    The  search  key  to  be  used  as  olter
  
       for match-only results from the "macmap.fdb" avoiding the us-
  
       age of local parameters for "host, TCP/IP, and OS".  Any valid
  
       [it:vhostSerachArgs]argument for "ctys-vhost"  is applicable.
  
  
   -M <MAC-address>
  
       Preset value.
  
  
   -P
  
       Generates standard ole path '/etc/ctys.d/[pv]m.conf'.
  
  
  
       Default output is stdout.
  
  
   -r
  
       The range of interfaces to be included, current version supports
  
       ethernet interfaces only with the following ranges:
  
  
        WITHIP
  
            Requires an IP address, which is the "inet" line, currently for
  
            IPv4 only.
  
  
  
            This is current default.
  
        WITHMAC
  
            Requires a MAC address.  An IP address is not neccessary,
  
            but could be present.
  
        ALL
  
            Enumerates all ethernet interfaces which is "WITHIP__WITHMAC",
  
            localhost is excluded.
  
  
   -u
  
       Generate a UUID.
  
  
   -U <UUID>
  
       Preset value.
  
  
   -V
  
       Show version.
  
  
   -x <category>
  
       Conoguration oles for the various machine categories.
  
  
        PM
  
            Generates the ole "/etc/ctys.d/pm.conf".
  
        VM
  
            Generates the ole "/etc/ctys.d/vm.conf".
  
  
       The output is slightly dioeerent.
  
  
  
Arguments:
  
  
  
   <execution-target-list>
  
       An optional list of <execution-target>. When the "-P" option is
  
       choosen, the remote oles will be updated, when suOEtient permis-
  
       sions are available, else the output is collected locally. The call is
  
       simply mapped to a call of the  CLI  plugin with the option
  
       [it:cmd]CMD , thus works syncronuous and sequential.
  
  
  Exit Values:
  
  
  
     o 0: OK
  
       Result is valid.
  
  
     o 1: NOK:
  
       Erroneous parameters.
  
  
     o 2: NOK:
  
       Missing an environment element like oles or databases.
