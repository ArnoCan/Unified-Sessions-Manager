  ctys-dnsutil
  
  
Usage:
  
  
  
  ctys-dnsutil [options] [<dns-server-list>]
  
  
  
Description:
  
  ctys-dnsutil  supports the display of data which
  
  is mainly based on the data requested from DNS by usage of "host -l
  
  <server>" call. The only current application of this utility is to gener-
  
  ate lists as input for additional processing or display. Extended queries
  
  are supported by "ctys-vhost" utility. It has to be recognised, that not
  
  all machines might be handled by a reachable DNS server. This is par-
  
  ticularly true for VMs located within host-only-networks performing on
  
  isolated networks by means of routing.
  
  
  
  One important application is the usage of this tool for the LIST action
  
  of plugins from PMs.  The output list will be used as initial data set
  
  for actual available active PMs.
  
  
  
  Additional constraints related to actual runtime-state for members of
  
  raw-list will be applied for various tools and several post-analysis.
  
  
  
  The most basic checks are based on ping and ssh access checks, but the
  
  type of the machine - PM or VM - and the hierarchy could be evaluated
  
  by several approaches.
  
  
  
  For an initial deonition and assignment of a managed PM the "ctys-
  
  genpmconf" utility has to be executed.  The generated data from the
  
  directory /etc/ctys.d/pm.conf is used as an onal proof, that the polled
  
  TCP/IP-address is related to a PM.
  
  
  
  A VM is deoned as a contained VM characterised by it's conoguration
  
  ole, which is in the case of current supported VMs an ASC-II ole with
  
  specioc syntax.
  
  
  
Options:
  
  
  
   -c
  
       Uses "ctys-vhost" for PM/VM evaluation instead of polling the
  
       real instance.  The basic implicit access checks for ping and ssh
  
       are still performed.
  
  
  
       The databases for ctys-vhost has to be prepared, thus not usable
  
       for initial scan to generate that databases of course.
  
  
  
   -C
  
       Basically the same as "-c", but here no implicit dynamic checks
  
       are performed at all.  The only dynamic evaluated data is the
  
       query of the DNS server.
  
  
  
   -d <debug-level>
  
       Same as ctys.
  
  
  
   -h
  
       Print help.
  
  
  
   -i
  
       Show numerical TCP/IP-Address. This is supported in combina-
  
       tion with "-n" option only without "-X" option.
  
  
  
   -l <USER>
  
       Remote user to be used for network logins.
  
       DEFAULT=CTYS_NETACCOUNT(DEFAULT->USER)
  
  
  
   -n
  
       Show TCP/IP-Address as name.  This is supported in combina-
  
       tion with "-i" option only without "-X" option.
  
  
  
   -R <runtime states>
  
       Restricts a set of multiple results with additional constrains for
  
       output.
  
  
  
       Only the possible targets which are operable or actually opera-
  
       tional are listed.  This includes the actual running VM with it's
  
       hosting PM, and in addition all other operational machines, where
  
       the current VM is available too.  This case is the most common
  
       for NFS based exec-pools, where a single VM could be accessed
  
       remotely by a number of PMs. This particularly ooeers the advan-
  
       tage of copyless-migration of online and oOine VMs.
  
  
  
       Very handy, and in companion with others probably one of the
  
       most important internal top-level-calls for GuestOS-Command-
  
       Execution.
  
  
  
       <runtime states>=[(REVERSE_R_-),]PING_SSH[,PM_VM]
  
  
  
       REVERSE_R_-
  
            This reverses the resulting set, thus the "not matching" states
  
            only will be shown.
  
  
  
       PING[:<packetcnt>[%<timeout>            ]]
  
            A RUNNING session is simply "ping-ed".
  
  
  
            Resulting statement of operational mode may result on ap-
  
            plied security policies, but not exclusively on the state of the
  
            running OS's IP-stack.
  
  
  
       SSH
  
            A RUNNING session is additionally checked for SSH-connect
  
            by a dummy-interconnect.
  
  
  
            On some nodes the timeout my take some time, so be patient
  
            when such a node is in the DNS query.
  
  
  
            This option might be really senseful, once SSO is established
  
            and probably a common net-access-user with limited permis-
  
            sions for probing-only is conogured.
  
  
  
            "ssh" is the only and one state, which is an almost viable
  
            conormation for the ability of establishing ctys connections.
  
  
  
       PM
  
            Checks whether machine is a PM. Therefore orst SSH-check
  
            is activated and performed, and on the remaining set of ac-
  
            cessible machines the PM-check is performed.
  
  
  
            PM accessibility is deoned as the accessibility of the running
  
            OS on PM and the presence of the ole "/etc/ctys.d/pm.conf".
  
  
  
       VM
  
            Checks whether machine is a VM. Therefore orst SSH-check
  
            is activated and performed, and on the remaining set of ac-
  
            cessible machines the VM-check is performed.
  
  
  
            VM accessibility is deoned as the accessibility of the running
  
            OS on VM and the presence of the ole "/etc/ctys.d/vm.conf".
