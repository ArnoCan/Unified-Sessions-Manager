<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<P>
The utility <B>ctys</B> is the core interface to be used within the UnifiedSessionsManager.
<B>ctys</B> encapsulates the user interfaces of the whole set of supported hypervisors and
native sessions into a common syntax with a single call interface.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</P>
<P>
<H2>Basics</H2>
</P>
<P>
<H3>Installation and Setup</H3>
</P>
<P>
The installation and configuration is descibed within the HowTo manual and the specific 
configuration guides.
The basic installation should work almost from the box, once the prerequisites are present.
The most valuable tool for verifying the setup of ctys is <B>ctys-plugins</B> which performs 
a validation of local and remote installations and displays a detailed report.
<br />
<br />
</P>
<P>
<H3>Configuration</H3>
The majority  of the preset default values could be changed by configuration files
and environment variables.
The configuration files are installed by default within <B>$HOME/.ctys</B> directory tree.
<br />
<br />
</P>
<P>
<H3>VMs and PMs - Sessions Namebinding</H3>
The most important aspect for the introduction of a common interface is the 
unique namenbinding for addressing the user sessions to physical machines, supported hypervisors
and guest OSs.
The session in this case is defined as a representation of the lifetime for the active state
of the runtime entity.
</P>
<P>
Each session could span multiple logins from multiple users, dependent from the individual setup.
Thus the namebinding of the sessions and their related attributes becomes the most important
feature for the management of the distributed user environments.
</P>
<P>
The specific actions required for the evaluation of the sessions namebinding are
distinguished by their types:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>HOSTs</B>: 
 <br /> 
HOSTs are pure dynamic sessions, without persistent data.
Thus for the namebinding the calculation of dynamic values, or in case of present instances
the mapping of values and instances is required.
<P></P>
<LI><B>VMs</B>:
 <br /> 
VMs are based on persistent configuration data. Thus stored data from configuration 
files is evaluated.
<P></P>
<LI><B>PMs</B>:
 <br /> 
PMs are accessed by a two folded approach. First the external access to the box is performed
by the addressing schema of the provided access protocol. Second, when configuration data of
physical host and/or the performed guest OS is required, a single data set positioned at specific
locations is evaluated.
</UL>

<P>
Two basic access-approaches are provided for VMs:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>scanning</B>: Scans for each call the filesystem for required configurations.
<LI><B>caching</B>: Queries a pre-populated cache database for required information.
</UL>

<P>
The scanning approach does not require additional preparation, 
just some basic setup like the root-directory to start.
The caching approach requires the previous scan of a list of targets and the
storage of their resulting inventory data into a so called local cacheDB
(<A HREF="../../images/addressResolution.png">Address-Resolution</A>)
.
</P>
<P>
The supported core utilities are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>ctys-vdbgen</B> - for automated scans
<LI><B>ctys-vhost</B> - as a database front-end for the cacheDB
</UL>

<P>
These provide particularly the dynamic network related data for caching and offer 
an enhanced query interface.
<br />
<br />
</P>
<P>
<H2>Option Groups</H2>
The options are grouped into two sections:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>ACTIONS</B></DT><DD>
These are options directly related to specific plugins.
ACTIONS are suboptions to the <B>-a</B> option and are preset by the actual 
loaded plugin controlled by <B>-t</B> and <B>-T</B> options.
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>Generic Attributes</B></DT><DD>
These are the options which are mostly generic within the whole set of utilities.
They influence the ACTIONS, but are related to the runtime environment.

<P>
CANCEL terminates running sessions of present plugins.
This includes HOSTs, VMs, and PMs.
Thus beneath the handling of virtual and login sessions the management of physical machines is included.
The CANCEL method includes therefore the handling of state dependencies in a hierarchical manner too.
This is e.g. when a physical machine is going to be canceled - shutdown, than the contained remaining
sessions are going to be canceled too.
Therefore a vertical dependency is defined, which recognizes and handles the nested execution of
contained sub-sessions too.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
CANCEL works by default asynchronously, thus is usable in parallel for emergency shutdowns by typing quickly
a short syntax.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>&lt;machine-address&gt;</B></DT><DD>
Refer to common options parts description.
<P></P>
<DT><B>ALL</B></DT><DD>
Cancels all instances of actually loaded plugins collected by a list call.
<P></P>
<DT><B>CLIENT|SERVER|BOTH</B></DT><DD>
Selection of the VM parts to be CANCELed.
<P></P>
<DT><B>FORCE</B></DT><DD>
Cancels the stack by call to hypervisor without forward propagation.
If supported, a kill call is performed after a timeout.
<P></P>
<DT><B>STACK</B></DT><DD>
Cancels a stack by forward propagation of CANCEL requests.
If supported, a kill call is performed after a timeout.
<P></P>
When handling stacks of nested PMs and VMs, the application of CANCEL
action on a lower level will force contained instances to be
terminated too.
Thus the behaviour has to be pre-selected, whether a 'top-down' soft shutdown
has to be performed, or a 'bottom-up' behaviour of instances, by killing the
assigned level without recognition of contained instances.
This might be appropriate e.g. in emergency cases.
Two basic directions are defined:
<P></P>
 <DL>
 <DT><B>FORCE</B></DT><DD>
As described above.
 <P></P>
 <DT><B>STACK</B></DT><DD>
Uses a chained approach for shutting down by a
top-down behaviour. Therefore the VM-stack will be
first walked up and marked by repetitive sub-calls
with defined specific CANCEL suboptions.
 <P></P>
Due to implementation specifics some remapping of inner states is
performed.
The mode of operation is controlled by following
parameters. When not given, the default CANCEL mode is
applied, which is a SHUTDOWN/STOP for servers and an
UNIX-kill for client processes.
 <P></P>
  <DL>
  <DT><B>INIT:&lt;init-state&gt;</B></DT><DD>
Mapped to UNIX init.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>PAUSE</B></DT><DD>
The VM will be paused immediately, remaining clients
will be "UNIX-killed", not so if SERVER selected.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>SUSPEND</B></DT><DD>
The VM will be suspended immediately, remaining clients
will be "UNIX-killed", not so if SERVER selected.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>RESET</B></DT><DD>
A reset is performed on any instance immediately,
remaining clients will be "UNIX-killed", not so if
SERVER selected.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>REBOOT</B></DT><DD>
Performs a "soft reset", where the instances will be
given a timeout before forcing them to terminate.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>POWEROFF[:&lt;timeoutBeforeKillVM&gt;]</B></DT><DD>
A multilevel-delayed SHUTDOWN of VMs is performed.
  </DL>
 </DL>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>SELF</B></DT><DD>
Includes the execution target as final system to be
canceled. Else the upper stack beginning with the
&lt;machine-address&gt; is canceled only. If no upper stack
is present nothing will be done.
<P></P>
<DT><B>RESET</B></DT><DD>
Resets the target with forward propagation on stacks.
RESET utilizes the native call of the hypervisor as a second step
when FORCE is not set.
<P></P>
<DT><B>REBOOT</B></DT><DD>
Reboots the target, the behaviour is similar to RESET, but for
the second step the hypervisor is not used.
Thus a REBOOT call with FORCE flag set and SELF flag unset
will not perform any CANCEL action, whereas RESET calls the
hypervisor as the only action.
<P></P>
A REBOOT call without FORCE flag set and SELF flag unset
will perform a stack propagation, and thus in case of missing native
GuestOS support for ctys the hypervisor will be called by the
propagation function.
<P></P>
<DT><B>INIT:&lt;init-state&gt;</B></DT><DD>
Performs an native INIT on UNIX systems with forward propagation by remapping of the
INIT request .
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>PAUSE|S3</B></DT><DD>
Calls PAUSE when supported, which is an ACPI state S3.
<P></P>
<DT><B>SUSPEND|S4</B></DT><DD>
SUSPEND has almost the same behaviour as PAUSE, the
only difference is the state S4.
<P></P>
<DT><B>POWEROFF|S5[:&lt;timeoutBeforeKillVM&gt;])</B></DT><DD>
POWEROFF or ACPI state S5, switches into offline
mode, which is actually a stand-by mode.
Within UnifiedSessionsManager the configuration of WoL is
pre-required in order to activate systems from state S5.
<P></P>
<DT><B>TIMEOUT:&lt;timeout-value&gt;</B></DT><DD>
Timeout after forward propagation of a CANCEL request, this is used for each of contained
levels. 
<P></P>
<DT><B>USER:&lt;user&gt;%[&lt;credentials&gt;]</B></DT><DD>
The user to be used for native access to the &lt;action-target&gt;.

The CREATE action starts local and remote sessions for supported plugins.
The desribed part within this document is the generic superset for all plugins,
where specific plugins may support less options than depicted here.
This is due to specific restrictions.
For example the CLI session may not require a configuration file due it's solely dynamic
nature.
In some exceptional cases the specific plugin may provide an additional attribute,
what should be avoided when ever possible.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
The CREATE has to basic modes, the operational creation of session by starting an entity
and the initial creation of a session, which could be the installation of a VM.
Therefore the optional parameters BOOTMODE for variation of the default boot for CREATE of
a VM and the INSTMODE for the initial boot mode from a specific installation medium
are provided.
This is the case for the current version for some 'complete open source' solutions, where as
the more commercial products are for now foreseen to handle the installation of guest systems
with their own utilities.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
The CREATE action is additionally supported by several utilities, for the virtual machines in particular
by the guest system installer and configurator 
<B><A HREF="../man1/ctys-createConfVM.html"> ctys-createConfVM(1)</A></B>
.
This provides currently for some plugins the plug-and-play installation of virtual machines including
the guest system, while for some commercial products for now the creation of additional configuration
information is provided only.
This temporary restriction is due to the actual amount of proprietary interfaces to be adapted, which
is going to be provided.
The particular support for the CREATE session is given by persistently provided default values, which
omit long commandline strings and represent a distributed database for example for the mapping of
user defined strings as execution shortcuts.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
The main advance of the common neatless syntax for CREATE ist the unique interface syntax for the start
of plugins with various frontends.
This particularly provides for the various application fields with either user desktops, or server
based backend setups.
Therefore following in addition to the various BOOTMODEs and INSTALLMODEs, the available CONSOLEs
are listed.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
Another point to be mentioned here is the advanced addressing feature, which is the generic superset for
all provided pluging.
This so called <B>&lt;machine-address&gt;</B> provides particularly a common set of attributes to be used either in
combination or solely - when unambitious - is provided.
Again some attributes may be omitted case by case, but some in general.
So the UUID is not applicable by definition for a CLI session, which is just a remote login.
Whereas it might not be available in some cases only for a VM or a PM, e.g. due to access permissions.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
The CREATE action also provides options, which are listed as generic options but may effect the frame of
the created session only.
These are particularly related to sharing and restarting of sessions as well as for their presentation
on graphical desktops.
These include sizes as well as screen and workspace position.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
The following given sub-options are not order dependent, the
keywords are case-insensitive.
For call details refer to the specific package.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>&lt;machine-address&gt;</B></DT><DD>
Refer to common options parts description.
<P></P>
<DT><B>BOOTMODE[:&lt;boot-img-pathname&gt;]</B></DT><DD>
<PRE>
  
  BOOTMODE:
    (
      KERNEL
      |PXE
      |FDD
      |CD
      |vHDD|HDD
      |ISO

    )
  
</PRE>
<P></P>
The BOOTMODE parameter supports the alteration between pre-configured
boot setups, which is specific to the boot media and the applied hypervisors.
The usage of this parameters requires a wrapper script specific to
the UnifiedSessiosnManager or a specific configuration variant to be in place.
For additional information refer to the test-cases and pattern within the installed 
directory tree in <B>$HOME/ctys</B>. 
The following table lists the various support options for current base-plugins.

The CONSOLE supports a common user access facility, which could be
an ordinary CLI interface to be used within a shell, as well as a
VNC based remote desktop accesible from a X11 based local desktop.
<P></P>
The main distinction between a CONSOLE and the HOSTs access is the
direct and native access of a CONSOLE to a hypervisor facility,
whereas a HOSTs session is an ordinary full-scale login into the
running GuestOS.
<P></P>
In addition to the currently supported explicit choices, almost any
type of local or remote frontend could be provided by combining
DISPLAYFORWARDING, CONNECTIONFORWARDING and an explicit call by CMD 
suboption of CLI or X11 plugin.
For examples refer to CLI-Examples and X11-Examples.

<DT><B>INSTMODE:&lt;boot-mode&gt;%&lt;inst-boot-source&gt;%&lt;insttargetmode&gt;%&lt;insttarget&gt;%&lt;inststage&gt;</B></DT><DD>
The instmode parameter manages the second stage of an installation process, once
the configuration files are prepared.
All parameters are mandatory, but could partly be replaced by the keyword 
<B>default</B>(current version requires NOT UPPER CASE).
Current version supports this option for QEMU/KVM only.
</DL>

 <DL>
 <DT><B>&lt;boot-mode&gt;</B></DT><DD>
The mode to boot, available modes are: CD, DVD, FDD, HDD, USB, PXE, VHDD.
Where VHDD is equivalent to HDD.
 <P></P>
 <DT><B>&lt;inst-boot-source&gt;|default</B></DT><DD>
The path to the install medium. This could be preconfigured within the configuration files.
The fully qualified pathname is required.
When <B>default</B>, the preconfigured values from the conf-file are used.
 <P></P>
<B>REMARK:</B> For now <B>lowercase</B> for <B>default</B> is required.
 <P></P>
 <DT><B>&lt;insttargetmode&gt;</B></DT><DD>
The mode for the target to be installed. Available modes are: HDD, USB, VHDD.
 <P></P>
 <DT><B>&lt;insttarget&gt;|default</B></DT><DD>
The path to the medium for the installed system. This could be preconfigured within the configuration files.
The fully qualified pathname is required.
When <B>default</B>, the preconfigured values from the conf-file are used.
 <P></P>
<B>REMARK:</B> For now <B>lowercase</B> for <B>default</B> is required.
 </DL>

 <DL>
 <DT><B>&lt;inststage&gt;</B></DT><DD>
The stage of installation.
 <DT></DT><DD>
<B>INIT:</B>
The 'INIT' stage prepares the install devices by erasing them, thus has to be
suppressed in case of a required reboot durcing the installation process.
 <DT></DT><DD>
<B>default:</B>
Avoids the reset of the device contents.
 </DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>PING:(ON|OFF|&lt;repetition&gt;%&lt;sleep&gt;)</B></DT><DD>
Controls whether access to the CREATE target should be verified
before with the option of polling until success.
<P></P>
PING is used as first to verify accesibility of the TCP stack,
before the actual access permission is checked by SSHPING.
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>REUSE</B></DT><DD>
Basically the same as CONNECT, but creates new sessions if required.
<P></P>
<DT><B>RECONNECT</B></DT><DD>
Basically the same as REUSE, with the difference, that
any client session will be terminated before a new ONE
is established. 
<P></P>
When RECONNECT sub-option is given, any previously
running client(and only the clients!) will be
canceled before starting the new client. This could be
restricted by assigning access-rights to any of current
clients, which has to be handled by underlying security
layer.
<P></P>
Therefore the hypervisor has to be configured properly for the server behaviour.
<P></P>
<DT></DT><DD>
<B>DISPLAYFORWARDING</B>
 <br /> 
Client an server processes run on the server machine, the display is forwarded 
by means of the GUI only.
<P></P>
<DT></DT><DD>
<B>CONNECTIONFORWARDING</B>
 <br /> 
The client process is executed on the caller's machine and connected to the server 
by a seperate SSH tunnel.

ENUMERATE collects the stored static configuration data of all VMs.
Therefore the filesystem is scanned for all known types of configuration files with specific matching
filters.
These could be displayed in various formats and content-sets as selected by suboptions.
The display could be either formatted for human display, e.g. by table output,
or for machine processing in database conformant ASC-II formats.
The set of content is controlled by the provided constraints for specific attributes.
The enumeration is applied for local and remote sessions, where lists of start-directories for
filesystem scans could be individually defined.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
The data is collected for each loaded plugin with stored configuration such as VMs and PMs, dynamic
plugins such as of type HOSTs have for now no individual static configuration data, thus are not
included in the enumeration.
These are displayed by the dynamic method LIST.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
The enumeration includes beneath the filtering for specific VM attributes in addition the filtering
for some dynamic operational states.
This comprises additionally the actual availability of the hypervisor, which depends of the
present runtime configuration.
In case of Xen for example the appropriate kernel has to be running, or in case of QEMU on x86 the
KVM or KQEMU kernel modules define whether QEMU is used in emulation mode only, or as KVM with
kernel based acceleration.
The same for KQEMU.
 <br /> 
</P>
<P>
The scan could be either proceeded for collection of the actually executable hypervisors on each node,
or for the presence of any configuration of potentially executable stored VMs.
In case of multiple installed hypervisors, which could be used e.g. by the boot with a different kernel,
the latter has some advantages when a test environment is to be setup.
Another application is to control the exclusion of templattes and backups, which may cause some ambiguity
within the database else.
</P>
<P>
The scope of the scanned states is controlled by the <B>vstat-enum</B>  with the commandline attribute
by the suboption <B>MATCHVSTAT</B>, which controls the output dependent of the dynamic and/or static state.
Currently the following enumeration attributes are defined.
</P>
 <UL>
 <LI><B>ALL</B>
 <br /> 
   Ignores the actual availability of a specific hypervisor.
   This is convenient for test environments, where the hypervisor
   on a machine is exchanged frequently.
 <LI><B>ACTIVE</B>
 <br /> 
   Active, available for execution. This is the configuration file is present, and staticly enabled by the
   VMSTATE attribute.
 <LI><B>BACKUP</B>
 <br /> 
   Backup, not available for execution.
 <LI><B>CUSTOM</B>
 <br /> 
   Custom state, available for execution.
 <LI><B>DISABLED</B>
 <br /> 
   Disabled, not available for execution.
 <LI><B>EMPTY</B>
 <br /> 
   Empty, available for execution.
 <LI><B>ENABLED</B>
 <br /> 
   Active and executable by actually available hypervisor. This is the present ACTIVE state and the operational
   and ENABLED presence of the hypervisor in SERVER mode.
 <LI><B>IGNORE</B>
 <br /> 
   Ignored, not available for execution.
 <LI><B>PRESENT</B>
 <br /> 
   Present, not available for execution.
 <LI><B>TEMPLATE</B>
 <br /> 
   Template, not available for execution.
 <LI><B>TESTDUMMY</B>
 <br /> 
   Test, available for execution.
 </UL>

<P>
The output is as listed in the following record description.
Some exceptions occur, when multiple interfaces are configured
within a VM.
Each interface is assigned with each of it's IP address to a
seperate output record, containing a single MAC address and a single
assigned TCP address.
Thus the number of output records is increased for multihomed VMs
and PMs resulting in one entry for each interface address.
</P>
<P>
Some additional values are supported for basic management
of VMs by simply adding masked keywords to present
configuration files and/or directories.
When "-X" option is set, the output is prepared as
";" semicolon seperated list for post-processing. The same
is true, when setting TERSE.
The MACHINE keyword for full data set as a canonical record implies
TERSE.

LIST disyplays the realtime runtime data related to actually running local and remote sessions.
Therefore the LIST action is a dynamic method in difference to the ENUMERATE action displaying
static data.
Even though the LIST action is focussing on dynamic data some additional static data is required for
mapping purposes and completion of the human readable information.
Therefore the dynamic runtime information of the plugins may contain at least some identifiers in order
to access the persistently stored data within the configuration files.
Also some dynamic data related to the control of jobs and their forked and parallel executed background subjobs
is stored in semi-persistend caches.
This is particularly required for some nested distribution of subjobs.
<br />
</P>
<P>
All loaded types are listed by filtering according to provided suboptions. 
The base set to be filtered is defined by the options "-t"
and/or "-T". If "-t" is not present, the default "-t ALL" will
be applied to all pre loaded plugins.
For changing the selection scope of listed users refer to "-s" option.
<br />
</P>
<P>
The LIST action is deeply influenced by the setting of the option "-b"
concerning the performance, and the option "-C" concerning the way the output data is displayed.
The basic influence on the display is described in "Parallel And Background Operations" 
the perfomance repercussion is presented in "Performance Measures".

LIST supports various display modes, where the displayed

In addition this option controls the execution of VM-Stacks, which are
closely coupled to GROUPS as well as to the background mode,
refer to "Stacks As Vertical Subgroups".
<P></P>
 <UL>
 <LI><B>stack-mode</B>:
 <br /> 
  The stack-mode is a specific enforcement of an appropriate combination
  for asynchronous operation sof the VMs within an sequential dependant
  nested VMSTACK.
  Therefore the values SEQ and SYNC are forced and blocked, thus could
  not be reset for the actual VMSTACK.
 <P></P>
  The VMSTACK in addition decouples CONSOLE operations, though these
  frequently block the STDIO due to SSH only operations.
  The dialogue components of a VMSTACK are generally proceeded in ASYNC
  mode, but after the previous non-interactive task has finished.
  The finish of a non-interactive task is here the successful startup of
  a VM/PM.
 <P></P>
 <LI><B>detachment of jobs</B>:
 <br /> 
  The detachment of jobs from the callers console causes the
  top level dispatcher to start all resulting jobs by the "-f"
  option of "ssh" and to return immediately. This results in a
  number of unmanaged jobs which implicitly are executed as
  autonomous parallel tasks by OpenSSH. The consequence of this
  is, that no higher level group functions could be performed
  on the whole set of results. 
  Typical examples are
 <P></P>
  <UL>
  <LI><B>CREATE</B>:
 <br /> 
    CREATE is performed by default as a DETACHED job, because it
    just creates interactive desktop sessions which are
    frequently not dependent on each other.
  <LI><B>LIST</B>:
 <br /> 
    LIST is performed by default as ATTACHED job, because it
    has some overall properties for tasks spanning multiple
    targets like SORTALL, where the individual sets could be
    intermixed. 
  <P></P>
  </UL>
 <LI><B>execution</B>:
 <br /> 
  The high-level PARALLEL execution with ATTACHED console
  combines both advantages. The parallel execution reduces for
  bulk lists of targets the overall processing time to the
  slowest individual by controlled dispatch. Second it keeps
  the overall synchronity for performing group tasks like SORT.
  Typical examples are
  <UL>
  <LI><B>CREATE</B>:
 <br /> 
    CREATE is performed by default as a DETACHED job as stated
    before. In the case of DETACHED the PARALLEL property has no
    effect, because jobs with "ssh -f" return "successfully"
    straight after execution.
  <LI><B>LIST</B>:
 <br /> 
    LIST is performed by default as ATTACHED job, thus the
    PARALLEL property has frequently a tremendous effect. 
    When listing a a set of 20 machines where each requires
    about 15 seconds to scan all processes and calculate the
    results for each plugin, the overall processing time is
    reduced from 300seconds=5minutes to 15seconds.
  <P></P>
  </UL>
 </UL>
<DT>_</DT><DD>
Therefore the two properties complement each other, even though
some similar effects could occur.
<P></P>
<B>REMARK</B>: The usage of "&amp;" by shell expansion will just superpose
the internal job control, which should avoided.

The operations of ctys utilize special virtual-nameservice information where this 
option controls the usage and selection of the distributed caches at the local and/or remote site.
<P></P>
Even though for performance only aspects the usage of cached data could be
suppressed, for the utilisation of stacked VMs the availability of the cache facility is mandatory.
<P></P>
The UnifiedSessionsManager itself is designed as a distributed
client-server system operating itself by distributing it's tasks to
the managed entities, and propagation of the required states within the
vertical stack-dependencies.
For this tasks at almost each point of operations ctys requires access
data for it's managed objects.
<P></P>
Therefore the UnifiedSessionsManager supports a distributed cache model
consisting of multiple cache databases - cacheDBs - which has to be
in sync if present, atleast might not contain inconsistent data.
Partly present data will be handeled by match-priority.
Alternatively the filesystem is scanned for available configuration
files of VMs, once the execution target is entered.
<P></P>
The following flags are supported in order of control which
nameservice-caches has to be used, or ignored.
The default behaviour is to use "BOTH" caches, and to scan the
filesystem on the execution target if no cache-hit occurs.
For additional information refer to Section "Distributed Nameservice and CacheDB" 
<P></P>
 <UL>
 <LI><B>BOTH</B>
 <br /> 
  Use first local cacheDB, if no match occurs than delay for usage of
  cacheDB at the remote execution target.
  When no cache data is found, and the scanning of filesystem is still

  configuration data for plugins based ob conf-files. 
  The cache DB is created by the tool 
<B><A HREF="../man1/ctys-vdbgen.html"> ctys-vdbgen(1)</A></B>

 <P></P>
 <LI><B>LOCAL</B>

 <P></P>
  For the Local option one specific point is to be considered.
  The basic design and resulting implementation of the locally
  pre-fetched cache is based on the implementation of options evaluation
  with permitting repetition of the same option/suboption and the
  "Last-Win" philosophy.
  Values from caches are evaluated first, before the actual user
  supplied entries.
 <P></P>
  The entry available in the local cache is resolved to a fully qualified
  &lt;machine-address&gt; with all of it's actually present parts, and
  inserted as the first argument to the relevant ACTION of the current
  job from the internal schedular, before the local/remote task is
  finally executed.
  Thus  user supplied parts will superpose elements from the cache
  and may lead to desired and/or unintended deviation from the local
  contents of the cacheDB.
 <P></P>
  Anyhow, the input used for evaluation of the &lt;machine-address&gt;
  from the cacheDB should be in sync.
 <P></P>
 <LI><B>OFF</B>

  When no cache data is found, and the scanning of filesystem is still

  The cache DB has to be created by the tool ctys-vdbgen.

For ctys two basic types of data-caches are used. 
The first one is the plugin specific in-mem cache, where frequent
operations like "ps" for LABEL mapping will be cached for the lifetime
of a process.
The second is the cacheDB on-disk cacheing, which could span
multiple calls to a specific executable.
<P></P>
The in-mem caching is active by default, because the assumption
is made that the systems state might not alter relevant to ctys
within a call-cycle. This could be deactivated for the common
plugins by with the "OFF" option, which additionally.
<P></P>
The on-disk caching is used for two specific reasons.
<P></P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Enables collecting data for overall-processing like sort,
  where data from all remote tasks is prefetched on
  localhost into file system and postprocessed as one
  set. 
 <P></P>
 <LI>Boosts performance for repetitive access to remote data,
  particularly when this is required within the same task in
  periods of seconds. 
  Therefore an ageing timer will be set for having
  "neartime" data. The variable 
  SESSIONCACHEPERIOD (default=20seconds)
  controls the ageing timer.
 <P></P>
Even though the assumption that the systems state on a local
machine is "more ore less static" within an uncritical
ordinary call, this could not be said clearly for remote calls
with on-disk caching. Thus on-disk caching of runtime data is
off by default, except for collector actions, which do not
reuse the "pure-data" cache.
 <br /> 
 <P></P>
Following suboptions are applicable:
 <P></P>
 <LI><B>AUTO</B>
 <br /> 
  The behaviour in case of an LIFETIME exceed is changed to
  automatic remove of cache data. Missing files are silently
  created from origination. This is particularly foreseen for
  the internal usage of "ctys -a LIST".
  The AUTO suboptions is supported for local access only.
 <P></P>
 <LI><B>FIN:&lt;cache-filepath&gt;</B>
 <br /> 
  A user-defined cache file to be used instead of collecting
  remote data. This file has to contain previously cached
  data, which was held by usage of "KEEP" suboption.
  The same &lt;cache-filepath&gt; should be used.
 <P></P>
 <LI><B>FOUT:&lt;cache-filepath&gt;</B>
 <br /> 
  A user-defined cache file to be used instead of default,
  this is the read-write runtime cache.
  The filepath, if relative, is relative to "$MYTMP", but no "mkdir" is called.
  An absolute path is used literally.
 <P></P>
 <LI><B>KEEP</B>
 <br />

When connecting a user interface with it's server components
the following basic constellations could be distinguished:
<P></P>
 <UL>
 <LI><B>LOCALONLY</B>
<br />
  Client and server components are coallocated on users 
  workstation, the display is driven locally.
 <LI><B>DISPLAYFORWARDING</B>

  Client and server components are coallocated on server, and 
  the display is forwarded to the users workstation.
 <LI><B>CONNECTIONFORWARDING</B>
<br />
  Client and server are split, whereas the client component is 
  located on the users workstation and the server component is
  located on the server machine. The connection from
  server/client component is forwarded on application protocol
  level.
 <LI><B>CLIENTONLY</B>
<br />
  This is a client in standalone mode, still used internal 
  only, e.g. for COPY when performing phase-2 with remote-copy
  from local client.
 <LI><B>SERVERONLY</B>

  This is a server in a so called headless-mode.

In case of 2.) the current ID is checked for "$USER==root", if
not, than a warning is generated, but continued with procedure.
This is due to possible security flaws, when assigning root-ID
to an ordinary user. Anyhow, when using ctys from a system
account, this might be OK.
<P></P>
<B>REMARK</B>:
  When a user cannot be authentified by one of sudo or ksu,
  then the system waits for a user interaction.
  BUT, due to internal "silent" checks the stdio was
  redirected, of course. Thus the system seems to be
  "hanging", or requests "Password:" and seem not to continue
  afterwards, but it "may work". 
  This is a "natural dilemma", because within the generic
  check function called for each task several times the output
  has to be suppressed. Currently no detection for an
  exceptional User-Dialog request is implemented.
  So for now are two diagnosis facilities implemented:
<P></P>
 <UL>
 <LI>A warning as <B>HINT</B> is generated, when "<B>-w</B>"
    option for extended warning is set. This shows the
    wrapped native call, which should be called manually by
    cut/paste on the ACTUAL EXECUTING system.
 <LI>The system variable <B>CTYS_NOCALLWRAPPER</B> could be set,
    which deactivates the wrapping of stdio and stderr for
    the call wrapper only. 
 </UL>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT>_</DT><DD>
<P></P>
    This means, that some redirection for the call
    context is still active, because it is a required
    output data, or is simply bulk data which might flaw
    the whole sense of diagnosis.
<P></P>
  When typing a RETURN the process will continue, but
  disabling the current type of permission mechanism. This
  could be OK, when KSU and SUDO is set, and KSU has no
  permissions configured, but SUDO has. It could lead to an
  later error too, when none could be detected.
  This scenario occurs for:
<P></P>
 <UL>
 <LI><B>KSU</B>: Kerberos credential was timed-out.
 <LI><B>SUDO</B>: User and/or call are not configured in sudo for
    execution target.

    configured. This case can frequently be ignored safely.
 <LI>The only case where this can lead to an error is the
    missing permission for access to a proprietary client
    application.
 <P></P>
When using "<B>sudo</B>" the flag "<B>requirestty</B>" within "<B>/etc/sudoers</B>"
control whether a TTY is required or not. When in order to
avoid this uncomment the flag within sudoers file. The "<B>-z</B>"
