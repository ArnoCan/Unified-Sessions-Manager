Release Notes:
==============

01.08.001b04 / 20080817
-----------------------
  1. Minor editorial changes on documents.
  2. Additional short-documents extracted from the User-Manual
     for installation and first usage.


01.08.001b03 / 20080812
-----------------------
  1. Minor editorial changes on documents.
  2. Withdrawn website, due to problems with generated HTML-Code.


01.08.001b02 / 20080806
-----------------------

  1. First beta-version to be used publicly for non-critical production
     environments for flat sessions.
  2. The usage with stacked sessions as a group by VMSTACK requires
     some more efforts, but anyhow, could already used for simple
     tasks.
     The future versions will support more validation-checks for stack
     consistency, allow implicit start of partial stacks, reuse of
     partial stacks, and provide a more user-friendly Stack-Addressing
     schema.
  3. Some effort will be spend for the definition of a common
     configuration syntax to be mapped to the various hypervisor
     calls. PArticularly the configuration syntax for QEMU is a draft,
     but fully functioning version.
  4. Service reallaocation, suspend/resume, and online-reallocation
     is not yet supported.
  5. Emulated environments for embedded devices are for now just draftly
     tested by usage of debian for arm9.
  6. The basic functionality is quite stable and widely tested.
  7. Documentation is still in production, but should be absolutely
     helpful.
 

01.07.001a01 / 20080803
-----------------------

  1. This version is almost contains almost completely tested base
     functionality.
     Currently missing some VMSTACK constellations with QEMU within a
     VMware VM, due to difficulties with configuration of a VDE-Switch
     within a VMware based GuestOS. Xen works fined.

  2. Several performance issues solved, a considerable number of bugs
     corrected.

  3. The manual is extended from about 200 pages to more than 600
     pages. It is expected to add about 100-200 more pages.

  4. The next version is expected to be the base for CVS as a stable
     version. A minor bugfix version is foreseen to be released close
     to current version.


01.03.03a01
-----------

  1. This is the first public release, so called a pre-release.

     Even though stable and on daily business within the local
     environment, for the first step it might suffer from some
     errors within the various environments. 

     So some minor format errors might cause severe operational errors
     at the end, what hopefully will not happen.

     The thoroughly tested environment is CentOS-5.0, for gwhich it
     works perfectly.

  2. The main distribution site is sourceforge.net, whereas some
     additional documentation, particularly some standard office tools
     based documents and quick-patches will be first distributed via
     the project site "UnifiedSessionsManager.org".

  3. Some recent changes to the VM stack might not work for now, but
     will be available within the couple of days or few weeks. 

     This should not influence the management and usage of "flat" VMs.
