   ctys-vping [options] <group/machine-address>


Description:
============

   Uses ctys address resolution for resolving target addresses and
   validates acessibility by usage of "ping" only or when requested by
   combination of "ping" and "ssh" for assuring SSO access.

   Therefore the output is presented as a table, the input parameters
   are limited in comparison to native call of ping.

   Anyhow, the TCP/IP address is listed for additional usage of native
   ping, when extended analysis is required.

   The entities will be resolved and accessed as selected by
   options. The two methods are "ping" which assures the basic
   TCP/IP-stack access, or the combined ssh-access, which performs a
   "ping" check first, following an remote call of "echo" by usage of
   ssh. 

   For each successful passed entity the basic ssh access and SSO
   configuration could be seen as validated and accessible.


Options:
========

    -s
       Activates additional SSH access test. When SSO is not
       configured properly, a password challange dialog occurs.

    -l <remote-user>

       The remote user to be taken for ssh tests. Default is current
       user id.
     
    -h
       Print help.
     
    -V
       Version.
     
    -X
       Terse output format, effects "-V" when set left-of.
     
    
    <group/machine-address>
       Any target to be checked by host, will be ordinarily ping-ed
       after ctys-name-resolution to TCP/IP-address.
