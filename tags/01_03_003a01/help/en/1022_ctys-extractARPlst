   ctys-extractAPRlst [options] <group/machine-address-list-in-same-segment>


Description:
============

   Generates a sorted list of 3-column table containing:
     
      <nodename>
      <IP-Address>
      <MAC-Address>

   Therefore this takes a list of targets which has to be in the same
   segment as the executing machine. The list could contain any valid
   ctys <machine-address> or any <ctys-group> definition.

   The entities will be resolved and accessed as selected by
   options. The two methods are "ping" which assures the basic
   TCP/IP-stack access, and "arp" which lists the mapping as required.

   So the usage of this tool could be said providing
   "real-in-time-data", without the limitation to static configured
   MAC-IP mapping, so recognizing pool-addresses too. But it's
   application is limited by the area of a single segment.

   For additional segments the "ctys-extractMAClst" tool should be
   used, which relies on configuration data for DHCP servers.

   ctys-tools generally expect for input generated files with default
   column-order, which is defined by "-n".


Options:
========

   -n|-i|-m
       -n  Print sorted records: <name>;<MAC>;<IP>
       -i  Print sorted records: <IP>;<name>;<MAC>
       -m  Print sorted records: <MAC>;<name>;<IP>
     
    -h
       Print help.
     
    -p <db-dir-path> 
       Directory for data to be stored. This is - and has to be in
       this version - the same directory as used by ctys-vdbgen and
       ctys-vhost.

       So each file-based ctys-DB requires it's own maping file for
       now.  This is going to be extended when the LDAP based
       addressing is introduced.  Anyhow, this feature will remain,
       because it has some advantages for daily business when setting
       up small to medium networks or multiple test-environments.
          
       The hard-coded filename is "macmap.cfdb"
   
    -P
       Almost same as "-p", but takes default ctys-file-DB, provided
       by DEFAULT_DBPATHLST.

       Default output is stdout.

    -V
       Version.
     
    -X
       Terse output format, effects "-V" when set left-of.
     
     
    <ping-hostlist-in-same-segment>
       Any host within the same segment, will be ping-ed and arp-ed.
