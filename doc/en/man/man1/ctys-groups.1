.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBctys\-groups\fR lists and displays groups from groups DB and groups caches. This
tool utilizes ctys\-vhost and adds some usability to the more detailed interface parameters.

.P
The display can be applied for specific groups, subtrees, or for nested groups.
Also a tree\-view based on the UNIX command tree is included, which supports the listing of
components and subtrees from the variable CTYS_GROUPS_PATH.

.P
For additional infomation of groups syntax refer to \ecallHyperref{s:GroupResolution}{"GroupResolution"}.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fB[<group\-list>]\fR
An optional list of groups to be displayed only, if not provided all
present groups from directories within the variable CTYS_GROUPS_PATH
are scanned and displayed.
For additional information refer to the S\-OPTION\-OF\-CTYS\-VHOST.
The format of <group\-list> is:

.nf
  <group-list> =: <group-name>[(%| )<group-list>]
.fi


The seperator is here slightly different from the "ctys\-vhost" option.
For ctys\-groups optionally the common suboptions\-argument seperator
"%" or the common UNIX arguments seperator "SPACE" could be used as
seperator.

The usage of the listed <group\-names> is as follows:

.TP

\fBname\fR
The name is expected to be a group name, so search is performed
for a file of name "name".

.TP

\fBname/\fR
The name is expected to be a directory name, so search is performed
for a subdirectory within the CTYS_GROUPS_PATH.
All files within that subtree are listed.

.TP

\fBname01/name02/name03/\fR
The path is expected to be a subdirectory pathname, so search is performed
for a subdirectory\-path within the CTYS_GROUPS_PATH.
All files within that subtree are listed.

.TP

\fB/name01/name02/name03/\fR
The path is expected to be an absolute directory pathname, so search is performed
within the subtree of given path only.
All files within that subtree are listed.

.TP

\fB/name01/name02/name03/name\fR
The name is expected to be an absolute filename, so test is performed
for that file only.

.P
The nested containment hierarchy by "include" is expanded before
output in any case.
The following example lists the \fBdesktop/\fR and \fBscan/\fR directories.

.nf
  ctys-groups  scan/ desktops/
.fi
