<B>ctys-common-addresssyntax - Definition of the Generic Address Superset</B>
<br />
<br />
<br />
</P>
<H1>General</H1>
<P>
This document describes the common generic address syntax for single machines and groups of entities.
This suffices all supported systems and may for some plugins applicable as a subset only.
<br />
<br />
The current version provides almost only the 
 <b><a  href="#machine-address" >&lt;machine-address&gt;</a></b>
and the 
 <b><a  href="#GROUPS" >GROUPS</a></b>
objects, thus the remaining definitions were
required for the design of an extendable overal concept.
<br />
<br />
</P>
<H1>Basic Elements</H1>
<P>
The addressing facility including the namebinding is splitted into
a logical description as a general view and it's conrete adaptions
which could be implemented by multiple presentations.
The foreseen and implemented syntax scanners are designed to allow
implementation in a straight-forward manner
allowing an simple implementation of hierarchical structured syntax
definitions by nested loops.
</P>
<P>
The following characters are reservered syntax elements, 
the full set and description is given
in the chapter "Options Scanners - Reserved Characters". 
</P>
 <DL>
 <DT><B>'='</B>   </DT><DD>
Seperator for option and it's suboptions. 
 <DT><B>','</B></DT><DD>
Seperator for suboptions belonging to one set of suboptions. 
 <DT><B>':'</B></DT><DD>
Seperator for suboption keys and it's arguments.
 <DT><B>'\%'</B></DT><DD>
Seperator for suboption argument values.
 <DT><B>'()'</B></DT><DD>
Grouping character pair for target specific 
<B>context-options</B>
belonging to a common target a.k.a. host.
 <DT><B>'{}'</B></DT><DD>
Grouping arguments for multiple targets including their specific options
belonging to a common high-level-target a.k.a. 
<B>SUBTASK</B>
 </DL>

<P>
The current syntax description may not yet formally be
absolutely correct nor complete, but may cover the intended grade 
of open description and required understanding for it's application.
Some modifications are still under development.
<br />
<br />
</P>
<H1>Syntax Elements</H1>
<P>
The following namebinding founds the superset of addressing
attributes, which supports explicit addressing of
targets as well as generic addressing of multiple targets by using
search paths and content attributes in analogy to wildcards,
a.k.a. keywords or attribute value assertions.
</P>
<P>
The given sub-options are defined not to be order dependent,
the keywords are case-insensitive.
</P>
<P>
The contained paranthesis, angle, and square brackets are just
syntactic helpers.
When they are part of the syntax, they will be
quoted with single quotation marks.
</P>
<P>
The top-level addressed entity is the APPLICATION, thus here the <B>&lt;target-application-entity&gt;</B>.
This contains in analogy to the OSI model the machine as well as the access port.

<a  name="machine-address" </a>
The machine is addressed by the <B>&lt;machine-address&gt;</B>, which represents physical and virtual machines as well as
login-sessions provided by the HOSTs plugin.
The specific plugins may suppport a subset of the full scope, but the attributes <B>ID</B> and <B>LABEL</B> are mandatory in any case.
The <B>ID</B> attribuet is here either a persistent identifier, in case of a VM a configuration file, or a dynamic identifier
in case of the HOSTs plugin, e.g. for VNC the DISPLAY number excluding the port-offset.
Whereas it is defined for X11 as the PID.

The above minor variations take into account some common
implementation aspects.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>&lt;access-point&gt;:=&lt;physical-access-point&gt;[&lt;virtual-access-point&gt;]</B></DT><DD>
  The complete path to the execution environment.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;access-port&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The port to be used on the access-point.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;application&gt;:=&lt;host-execution-frame&gt;&lt;application-entity&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The application itself, which has to be frequently used in
  combination with a given service as runtime environment.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;application-entity&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The executable target entity of the addresses application,
  which could be an ordinary shell script to be executed by a
  starter instance, or an selfcontained executable, which
  operates standalone within the containing entity. E.g. this
  could be a shared object or an executable.
<P></P>
  The following extends the DISPLAY for seamless usage within
  ctys. So redirections of entities to any PM, VM of VNC session
  supporting an active Xserver will be supported. The only
  restrictions apply, are the hard-coded rejection of unencrypted
  connections crossing machine-borders.

  TDE - Target Display Entity address
  ===================================
  
  &lt;DISPLAYext&gt;:=&lt;target-display-entity&gt;
  
  &lt;target-display-entity&gt;:=&lt;tde&gt;
  &lt;tde&gt;:=&lt;tae&gt;:&lt;lde&gt;
  
</PRE>
<br />
<P></P>
<DT><B>(basepath|base|b):&lt;base-path&gt;{1,n}</B></DT><DD>
  Basepath could be a list of prefix-paths for usage by UNIX
  "find" command.
  When omitted, the current working directory of execution is
  used by default.
<P></P>
<DT><B>(filename|fname|f):&lt;mconf-filename&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  A relative pathname, with a relative path-prefix to be used
  for down-tree-searches within the given list of &lt;base-path&gt;.
<P></P>
  So far the theory. 
  The actual behaviour is slightly different, as though as a simple
  pattern match against a full absolute pathname is performed.
  Thus also parts of the fullpathname may match, which could be an
  "inner part".
  This is perfectly all right, as far as the match leads to unique
  results.
<P></P>
  More to say, it is a feature. 
  Though a common standardname, where the containing directory of a VM
  has the same name as the file of the contained VM could be written
  less redundant, when just dropping the repetitive trailing part of
  the name.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;host-execution-frame&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The starter entity of addressed container, which frequently
  supports a sub-command-call or the interactive dialog-access
  of users to the target system.
<P></P>
<DT><B>(id|i):&lt;mconf-filename-path&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The &lt;id&gt; is used for a variety of tasks just as a neutral
  matching-pattern of bytes, an in some cases as a uniqe VM identifier
  within the scope of single machine.
  The semantics of the data is handled holomporphic due to the variety
  of utilized subsystems, representing various identifiers with
  different semantics.
  Thus the ID is defined to be an abstract sequence of bytes to be
  passed to a specific application a.k.a. plugin, which is aware of
  it's actual nature.
<P></P>
  The advantage of this is the possibility of a unified handling of IDs
  for subsystems such as VNC, Xen, QEMU and VMware.
  Where it spans semantics from beeing a DISPLAY number and offset of a
  base-port, to a configuration file-path for a DomU-IDs, or a PID of
  a "master process".
<P></P>
  This eases the implementation of cross-over function like
  LIST, because otherwise e.g. appropriate access-rights to
  the file are required, which is normally located in a
  protected subdirectory. These has to be permitted, even
  though it might not be required by the actual performed
  function.
<P></P>
<DT><B>(LABEL|L):&lt;label&gt;</B></DT><DD>
<PRE>
  &lt;label&gt;={[a-zA-Z-_0-9]{1,n} (n&lt;30, if possible)}
</PRE>
User defined alias, which should be unique. Could be used for
any addressing means.
<B>MAC|M</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>(MAC|M):&lt;MAC-address&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The MAC address, which has basically similar semantically
  meaning due to uniqueness as the UUID.
<P></P>
  Within the scope of ctys, it is widely assumed - even though
  not really prerequired - that the UUIDs and MAC-Addresses are
  manual assigned statically, this could be algorithmic
  too. The dynamic assignment by VMs would lead to partial
  difficulties when static caches are used.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;mconf-filename&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The filename of the configuration file without the path-prefix.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;mconf-filename-path&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The complete filepathname of the configuration file.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;mconf-path&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The pathname prefix of the configuration file.
<P></P>
<DT><B>(PATHNAME|PNAME|P):&lt;mconf-path&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  When a VM has to be started, the &lt;pathname&gt; to it's
  configuration file has to be known. Therefore the &lt;pathname&gt;
  is defined. The pathname is the full qualified name within
  the callers namescope. SO in case of UNIX it requires a
  leading '/'.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;physical-access-point&gt;:=&lt;machine-address&gt;[:&lt;access-port&gt;]</B></DT><DD>
  The physical termination point as the lowest element of the
  execution stack. This is the first entity to be contacted
  from the caller's site, normally by simple network access.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;target-application-entity&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The full path of the stacked execution stack, addressing the
  execution path from the caller's machine to the terminating
  entity to be executed. This particularly includes any
  involved PM, and VM, as well as the final executable. Thus
  the full scope of actions to be performed in order to start
  the "On-The-Top" executable is contained.
<P></P>
<DT><B>(TCP|T):&lt;tcp/ip-address&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The TCP/IP address is assumed by ctys to assigned in fixed
  relation to a unique MAC-Address. 
<P></P>
<DT><B>(UUID|U):&lt;uuid&gt;</B></DT><DD>
  The well known UUID, which should be unique. But might not,
  at least due to inline backups, sharing same UUID as the
  original. Therefore the parameter FIRST, LAST, ALL is
  supported, due to the fact, that backup files frequently will
  be assigned a name extension, which places them in
  alphabetical search-order behind the original. So, when using
  UUID as unique identifier, a backup will be ignored when
  FIRST is used. 
<P></P>
  Anyhow, cross-over ambiguity for different VMs has to be
  managed by the user.
<P></P>
<DT><B>&lt;virtual-access-point&gt;:=&lt;machine-address&gt;[:&lt;access-port&gt;]</B></DT><DD>
  The virtual termination point as an element of the
  execution stack. The stack-level is at least one above the bottom
  This stack element could be accessed either by it's operating 
  hypervisor, or by native access to the hosted OS.
<P></P>
<br />
<br />
</DL>

<H1>Stack Addresses</H1>
<P>
The stack address is a logical collection of VMs, including an
eventually basic founding PM, which are in a vertical dependency.
The dependency results from the inherent nested physical execution
dependency of each upper-peer from it's close underlying peer.
Therefore the stack addresses are syntactically close to
 <b><a  href="#GROUPS" >GROUPS</a></b>
with additional specific constraints, controlling execution dependency and
locality.
Particularly the addressing of a VM within an upper layer of a stack
could be smartly described by several means of existing path addresses
schemas.
Within the UnifiedSessionsManager a canonical form is defined for
internal processing(
<B>StacksAsVerticalSubgroups</B>
), 
which is available at the user interface too.
Additional specific syntactical views are implemented in order
to ease an intuitive usage for daily business.
The following section depicts a formal meta-syntax as a preview of the
final ASN.1 based definition.
A stack address has the sytax as depicted in 
Figure <B>Stack-Address</B>.

A stack can basically contain wildcards and simple regexpr for the various
levels, groups of entities within one level could be provided
basically to.
And of course any MACRO based string-replacement is applicable.
But for the following reasons the following features are shifted to a later
version:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Wildcards:</B></DT><DD>
An erroneous user-provided wildcard could easily expnad to several
hundred VMs, which might be not the original intention.
Even more worst, due to the detached background operation on remote
machines, this can not easily be stopped, almost just ba reboot of the
execution target.
Which, yes, might take some time, due to the booting VMs.
<P></P>
<DT><B>Level-Groups/Sets:</B></DT><DD>
Due to several highe priorities this version supports explicitly
addressed entries only.
<P></P>
<br />
<br />
</DL>

<H1>Groups Resolution</H1>
<P>
Groups are valid replacements of any addressed object, such as a HOST.
Groups can contain in addition to a simple set of hostnames a list of
entities with context specific parameters and include other groups in
a nested manner.
Each set of superposed options is permutated with the new included set.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of group names is processed by a search path algorithm
based on the 
variable 
</P>
 <DL>
 <DT><b><a  href="../man1/ctys-groups.html" >CTYS_GROUPS_PATH</a></b></DT><DD>
,
which has the same syntax as
the PATH variable.
The search algorithm is a first-wins filename match of a preconfigured
set.
Nested includes are resolved with a first-win algorithm beginning at
the current position.
 </DL>

<P>
In addition to simple names a relative pathname for a group file could
be used.
This allows for example the definition of arbitrary categories, such
as server, client, desktop, db, and scan.
Here are some examples for free definitions of categories based on
simple subdirectories to search paths.
The level of structuring into subdirectories is not limited.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>server/*</B></DT><DD>
A list of single servers with stored specific call parameters.
Server is used here as a synonym for a backend process.
Which could be either a PM or a VM, the characteristics is the 
inclusion of the backend process only.
<P></P>
<DT><B>client/*</B></DT><DD>
A list of single clients with stored specific call parameters.
This is meant as the user front end only, which could be a
CONNECTIONFORWARDING.
The user can define this category also as a complete client machine
including the backend and frontend, which is a complete client for a
service.
<P></P>
<DT><B>desktop/*</B></DT><DD>
A composition of combined clients and servers for specific tasks.
This could be specific desktops for office-applications, 
systems administration, software-development, industrial applications, 
test environments.
Either new entries could be created, or existing groups could be
combined by inclusion.
<P></P>
<DT><B>db/*</B></DT><DD>
Multiple sets of lists of targets to be scanned into specific caching
databases.
This could be used for a working set as well as for different views of
sets of machines.
<P></P>
<DT><B>scan/*</B></DT><DD>
A list of items to be scanned by tools for access validation and check
of operational mode.
Therefore this entities should contain basic parameters onyl, such as
machine specific remote access permissions type. 
</DL>

<P>
<B>REMARK:</B>
The group feature requires a configured SSO, either by SSH-Keys of
Kerberos when the parallel or async mode is choosen, which is the
default mode.
This is required due to the parallel-intermixed password request,
which fails frequently.
</P>
<P>
For additional information on groups refer to 
<B>GroupTargets</B>
and
 <b><a  href="../man1/ctys-groups.html" >ctys-groups</a></b>
.
</P>
<P>
<br />
<br />
</P>
<H1>Groups of Machines</H1>
<P>
The GROUPS objects are a concatination of &lt;machine-addresses&gt; and nested GROUPS including specific context options.
The end of the command with it's specific option should be marked by the common standard with a
double column <B>'--'</B>.
<br />
<br />

      ctys -a &lt;action&gt; -- '(&lt;glob-opts&gt;)' &lt;group&gt;'('&lt;group-opts&gt;')'

<P>
<br />
</P>
<P>
The context options are applied succesively, thus are 'no-real-context' options, much more a successive
superposition. More worst, the GROUP is a set, thus the members of a group are reordered for display and
execution purposes frequently.
So the context options are - in most practical cases - a required minimum for the attached entity.
</P>
<H1>Groups of Stack Addresses</H1>
<P>
The usage of stacked addresses is supported by the GROUPS objects for any entry, where an
address is required, except for cases only applicable to PMs,
e.g. WoL.
The usage of stacked addresses within groups is supported too.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the behaviour for global remote options on ctys-CLI is to
chain the option with any entity within the group, such as for the
single PM case in
Figure Group Stack Addresses.

<P>
This behaviour of "chaining options" results due it's intended mapping
to the internal canonical form before expanding it's options,
to the permutation of the &lt;group-options&gt; to each member of the group.
The same is true for the special group 
<B>VMSTACK</B>

that the global and context options are in case of groups just set for
