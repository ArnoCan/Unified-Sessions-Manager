   ctys-extractMAClst [options] <dhcp.conf-filename>


Description:
============

   Generates a sorted list of 3-column table containing:
     
      <nodename>
      <IP-Address>
      <MAC-Address>

   Therefore this tool requires a valid "dhcpd.conf"-Syntax as defined
   by ISC. 

   Static configured address mappings are supported only. Dynamic
   allocated leases of address ranges are not supported.

   ctys-tools generally expect for input generated files with default
   column-order, which is defined by "-n".


Options:
========

   -n|-i|-m
       -n  Print sorted records: <name>;<MAC>;<IP>
       -i  Print sorted records: <IP>;<name>;<MAC>
       -m  Print sorted records: <MAC>;<name>;<IP>
     
    -h
       Print help.
     
    -p <db-dir-path> 
       Directory for data to be stored. This is - and has to be in
       this version - the same directory as used by ctys-vdbgen and
       ctys-vhost.

       So each file-based ctys-DB requires it's own maping file for
       now.  This is going to be extended when the LDAP based
       addressing is introduced.  Anyhow, this feature will remain,
       because it has some advantages for daily business when setting
       up small to medium networks or multiple test-environments.
          
       The hard-coded filename is "macmap.cfdb"
   
    -P
       Almost same as "-p", but takes default ctys-file-DB, provided
       by DEFAULT_DBPATHLST.

       Default output is stdout.
