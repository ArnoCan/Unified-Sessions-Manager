 ========================

   Even though this chapter should contain generic examples only, this
   is not possible due to the bare character of the basic framework
   when missing and plugin. So specific examples of a initial standard
   subset is provided. Even though in some examples the "-t" option is
   not set, this just causes the default type, which is e.g. VNC for
   CREATE and CANCEL action, will be used.

   For additional information and examples refer to the previous
   sections for embedded examples within the plugins own documentation.
