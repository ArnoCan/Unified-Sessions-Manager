Usage:
  
  
  
  ctys-extractAPRlst [options] "
  
     <group/machine-address-list-in-same-segment>
  
  
  
Description:
  
  ctys-extractAPRlst  generates a sorted list of
  
  3-column table containing:
  
  
  
       <nodename>
  
       <IP-Address>
  
       <MAC-Address>
  
  
  
  Alternatively output to stdout could be generated for usage in "/etc/ethers".
  
  
  
       <MAC-Address> <nodename>
  
  
  
  or
  
  
       <MAC-Address> <IP-Address>
  
  
  
  Therefore this tool uses a list of targets which has to be in the same
  
  segment as the executing machine.  The list could contain any valid
  
  ctys <machine-address> or any <ctys-group> deonition.
  
  
  
  The entities will be resolved and accessed as selected by options. The
  
  two methods are "ping" which assures the basic TCP/IP-stack access,
  
  and "arp" which lists the mapping as required.
  
  
  
  So the usage of this tool could be said providing "real-in-time-data",
  
  without the limitation to static conogured MAC-IP mapping, so recog-
  
  nizing pool-addresses too. But it's application is limited by the area of
  
  a single segment.
  
  
  
  For additional segments the "ctys-extractMAClst" tool should be used,
  
  which relies on conoguration data for DHCP servers.
  
  
  
  ctys-tools generally expect for input generated oles with default column-
  
  order, which is deoned by "-n".
  
  
  
Options:
  
  
  
   -E
  
       Generates output for "/etc/ethers". This is required when using
  
       ether-wake for WoL, what is no longer supported by ctys.
  
  
  
       The options "-n" and "-i" become in combination with "-E" a
  
       slightly dioeerent semantic:
  
  
  
        -n output is "<MAC-addr> <DNS name>"
  
        -i output is "<MAC-addr> <dotted IP address>"
  
  
       The option is not supported with "-E".
  
  
   -n_-i_-m
  
  
  
        -n Print sorted records: <name>;<MAC>;<IP>
  
        -i Print sorted records: <IP>;<name>;<MAC>
  
        -m Print sorted records: <MAC>;<name>;<IP>
  
  
   -h
  
       Print help.
  
  
   -p <db-dir-path>
  
       Directory for data to be stored. This is - and has to be in this ver-
  
       sion - the same directory as used by ctys-vdbgen and ctys-vhost.
  
  
  
       So each ole-based ctys-DB requires it's own mapping ole for now.
  
       This is going to be extended when the LDAP based addressing is
  
       introduced. Anyhow, this feature will remain, because it has some
  
       advantages for daily business when setting up small to medium
  
       networks or multiple test-environments.
  
  
  
       The hard-coded olename is "macmap.cfdb"
  
  
   -P
  
       Almost same as "-p", but takes default ctys-ole-DB, provided by
  
       DEFAULT_DBPATHLST.
  
  
  
       Default output is stdout.
  
  
   -V
  
       Version.
  
  
   -X
  
       Terse output format, eoeects "-V" when set left-of.
  
  
  
Arguments:
  
  
  
   <ping-hostlist-in-same-segment>
  
       Any host within the same segment, will be ping-ed and arp-ed.
  
  
  Exit Values:
  
  
  
     o 0: OK
  
       Result is valid.
  
  
     o 1: NOK:
  
       Erroneous parameters.
  
  
     o 2: NOK:
  
       Missing an environment element like oles or databases.
