   ===================

    -a <action>[=<action-suboptions>]
    [--]                                     \
    ['('<any-options global for all remote>')']  \
    (([user@]<hostname>)|<groupname>)['('<any-options>')'][ ...] 


    These are the remote options which are given as global and
    individual options for each host. The options are (almost) the same
    as for common call.


    ATTENTION:
      "--" is required when using remote options, otherwise some
      problems with standard options might occur.


    <user>
      default:\${USER}=${USER}
      When instead the "-l" option likewise the r-functions is supported
      the given user(list) is permutated with the listed hosts.
      Particularly nice for bulk-tests, but anyhow a limit of about 20
      sessions to individual hosts (IP-addresses) is hardcoded to avoid 
      some "hard-coded-resets". This value could be reset by following
      envirnment variable:

         R_CREATE_MAX=${R_CREATE_MAX:-20}

    <hostname>
      default:'uname -n'(`uname -n`)

    <groupname>
      Any user defined group/macro, for additional information refer to
      ctys manual.

    <any-options>
      Any global option could be provided individually for each host.
      E.g. individual debugging level on that host only.
  
      One implementation specific to be aware of is, that these options 
      are superposed, but not reset, thus the current environment will 
      remain for the following host.
  
      Example:
       The following example shows three hosts, where each has a different 
       debugging level.
  
       First of all the debugging flag and level is not forward propagated,
       and as common for all other environment settings too, "the last wins".
  
         "...-d 6 -- ( -d 3 ) host01 host02( -d 1) host02(-d 0)..."
  
       So, the given options results in the following scenario:
   
        -> localhost:   -d 6          = -d 6
        -> host01:      -d 3          = -d 3
        -> host02:      -d 3 -> -d 1  = -d 1
        -> host03:      -d 3 -> -d 0  = -d 0
  
      - <command> 
        Command to be executed on the target host, which could be a
        native physical providing a remote dektop based on VNC, or a
        virtual machine like Xen. In any case the login will be
        performed by means of the target system, but the administrative
        support for neatless execution is provided by this tool.
