     ctys-install [<key>[=<value>]] ...

        Basic install and update-script for raw usage from 
        CLI when installed individually from filesystem.

        The basic operations could be controlled by the 
        following options and arguments. Two basic 
        applications could be distinguished:

        1. Individual Install
           Install by copy of configurations and 
           lib-subdirectory(default).

             "ctys-install"
             "ctys-install force"
             "ctys-install forceall"
             "ctys-install forceclean"


        2. Centralized Install
           Install configurations and symbolic 
           links only("linkonly").

             "ctys-install linkonly"
             "ctys-install linkonly force"
             "ctys-install linkonly forceall"
             "ctys-install linkonly forceclean"

        
        Following options are available:

              [libdir=<default=$HOME/lib>]

              [bindir=<default=$HOME/bin>]

              [remove<default=unset>]

              [force<default=unset>]
                Checks "ctys -V -X" alphebetically/literally, normally
                only updates are allowed, but force installs in any case.

                Current users configuration director $HOME/.ctys will be 
                left unchanged.

              [forceall<default=unset>]
                Checks "ctys -V -X" alphebetically/literally, normally
                only updates are allowed, but forceall installs in any case.

                Anthing, else than users configuration directory $HOME/.ctys,
                will be removed and installed again. The users current 
                configuration will be moved to $HOME/.ctys.bak.${DATETIME}.


              [forceclean<default=unset>]
                Checks "ctys -V -X" alphebetically/literally, normally
                only updates are allowed, but force installs in any case.

                Anthing, including current users configuration directory
                $HOME/.ctys, will be removed and installed again.

              [linkonly<default=unset>]
                Supress the local copy to  $HOME/lib directory, just 
                appropriate symbolic links are set to the given source 
                directory determined by this call.

                Anyhow, the cofiguration is copied and/or preserved as 
                usual.
