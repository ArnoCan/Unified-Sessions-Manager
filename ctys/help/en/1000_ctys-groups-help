Arguments:
  
  
  
   <group-list>
  
       An optional list of groups to be displayed only, if not provided all
  
       present groups from directories within the variable CTYS_GROUPS_PATH
  
       are scanned and displayed. For additional information refer to the
  
       [it:BasicDataManagementSupport]"-S" option of ctys-vhost .
  
  
  
       The format of <group-list> is:
  
  
  
       <group-list> =: <group-name>[(%_ )<group-list>]
  
  
  
       The seperator is here slightly dioeerent from the "ctys-vhost" op-
  
       tion. For ctys-groups optionally the common suboptions-argument
  
       seperator "%" or the common UNIX arguments seperator "SPACE"
  
       could be used as seperator.
  
  
  
       The nested containment hierarchy by "include" is expanded be-
  
       fore output in any case.
