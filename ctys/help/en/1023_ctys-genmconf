======

   ctys-genmconf <args>


Description:
============

   This tool generates the initial configuration entry for a PM or VM,
   which is stored in the directory "/etc/ctys.d/[pv]m.conf".

   The generation of data requires root access for some tools. Namely
   the utility "dmiencode", which is used to evaluate the UUID of the
   machine requires for execution root-permissions.

   The utility should therefore be executed once on each participating
   PM and VM by the administrator during installation, and should be
   completed manually with additional data.

   Preferrably the rpm package should be installed during initial
   installation phase, which will generate the appropriate
   configuration entries.


   The data from the pm.conf will be required for the ctys-vhost
   utility and is therefore fetched by the ctys-vdbgen utility and
   is evaluated by ctys-dnsutil for dynamic decision of node type.


Options:
========
    -h

    -k <ctys-vhost-search-key>

    -U <UUID>

    -V

       Default output is stdout.

    <args>
       VM
