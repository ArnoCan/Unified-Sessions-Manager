  ctys-smbutil
  
  
Usage:
  
  
  
  ctys-smbutil [options]
  
  
  
Description:
  
  ctys-dnsutil displays a short list of current avail-
  
  able SMB server and workstations.
  
Options:
  
  
  
   -d <debug-level>
  
       Same as ctys.
  
  
   -h
  
       Print help.
  
  
   -i
  
       Show numerical TCP/IP-Address. This is supported in combina-
  
       tion with "-n" option only without "-X" option.
  
  
   -n
  
       Show TCP/IP-Address as name. This is supported in combination
  
       with "-i" option only without "-X" option.
  
  
   -R <runtime states>
  
       Restricts a set of multiple results with additional constrains for
  
       output.
  
  
  
       Only the possible targets which are operable or actually opera-
  
       tional are listed.  This includes the actual running VM with it's
  
       hosting PM, and in addition all other operational machines, where
  
       the current VM is available too.  This case is the most common
  
       for NFS based exec-pools, where a single VM could be accessed
  
       remotely by a number of PMs. This particularly ooeers the advan-
  
       tage of copyless-migration of online and oOine VMs.
  
  
  
       Very handy, and in companion with others probably one of the
  
       most important internal top-level-calls for GuestOS-Command-
  
       Execution.
  
  
  
       <runtime states>=[(REVERSE_R_-),]PING_SSH[,PM_VM]
  
  
  
         REVERSE_R_-     This reverses the resulting set,  thus the "not
  
                  matching" states only will be shown.
  
         PING[:<packetcnt>[%<timeout>        ]] A RUNNING session is sim-
  
                  ply "ping-ed".
  
  
  
                  Resulting statement of operational mode may result
  
                  on applied security policies, but not exclusively on the
  
                  state of the running OS's IP-stack.
  
  
   -V
  
       See ctys, version output.
  
  
   -X
  
       See ctys, terse for machine output.
  
  
  Exit Values:
  
  
  
     o 0: OK
  
       Result is valid.
  
  
     o 1: NOK:
  
       Erroneous parameters.
  
  
     o 2: NOK:
  
       Missing an environment element like oles or databases.
