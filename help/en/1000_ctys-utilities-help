  Following support-utilities are provided with ctys:
  
  
  
  1.1 ctys-install
  
  
Usage:
  
  
  
  ctys-install [<key>[=<value>]] ...
  
  
  
Description:
  Basic install and update-script for raw usage from CLI when installed indi-
  vidually from olesystem.
  
  
  The basic operations could be controlled by the following options and argu-
  ments. Two basic applications could be distinguished:
  
  
  
    1. Individual Install
       Install by copy of conogurations and lib-subdirectory(default).
  
  
  
            "ctys-install"
            "ctys-install force"
            "ctys-install forceall"
            "ctys-install forceclean"
  
  
  
    2. Centralized Install
       Install conogurations and symbolic links only("linkonly").
  
  
            "ctys-install linkonly"
            "ctys-install linkonly force"
            "ctys-install linkonly forceall"
            "ctys-install linkonly forceclean"
  
  
  
  Following options are available:
  
  
  
  Options
  
  
  [libdir=<default=$HOME/lib>]
  
  
       DEFAULT=$HOME/lib
       The root path for the physical install target. The actual physical
       install is handled by a name including the current version in a
       similar manner as shared libraries naming convention.
  
  
  [bindir=<default=$HOME/bin>]
  
  
       The path to the starter directory, which is contained in the PATH
       variable.
       Symbolic link: $bindir/ctys -> $libdir/ctys.<version>/bin/ctys
       Bootstrap ole: $bindir/bootstrap/bootstrap.<version>
  
  
  [templatedir=<default=$HOME/ctys>]
  
  
       Directory to templates and test-data matching current version.
       When an emtpy string is set, the install is suppressed, and the
       templates are contained within the libdir only.
  
  
  [remove<default=unset>]
  
  
       Removes previous conoguration and templates.
  
  
  [noconf<default=unset>]
  
  
       Suppresses the install of initial conoguration oles. Could be some-
       what dangerous, because some essential parameters are stored
       within the conoguration and should match the executed version.
  
  
  [force<default=unset>]
  
  
       Checks "ctys -V -X" alphabetically/literally, normally only up-
       dates are allowed, but force installs in any case.
  
  
  
       Current users conoguration director $HOME/.ctys will be left
       unchanged.
  
  
  [forceall<default=unset>]
  
  
       Checks "ctys -V -X" alphebetically/literally, normally only up-
       dates are allowed, but forceall installs in any case.
  
  
  
       Anything, else than users conoguration directory $HOME/.ctys,
       will be removed and installed again. The users current conogu-
       ration will be moved to $HOME/.ctys.bak.$DATETIME.
  
  
  [forceclean<default=unset>]
  
  
       Checks "ctys -V -X" alphebetically/literally, normally only up-
       dates are allowed, but force installs in any case.
  
  
  
       Anything, including current users conoguration directory $HOME/.ctys,
       will be removed and installed again.
  
  
  [linkonly<default=unset>]
  
  
       Suppress the local copy to $HOME/lib directory, just appropriate
       symbolic links are set to the given source directory determined
       by this call.
  
  
  
       Anyhow, the conoguration is copied and/or preserved as usual.
