  ctys-vping
  
  
Usage:
  
  
  
  ctys-vping [options] <group/machine-address>
  
  
  
Description:
  
  ctys-vping  uses ctys address resolution for re-
  
  solving target addresses and validates accessibility by usage of "ping"
  
  only or when requested by combination of "ping" and "ssh" for assur-
  
  ing SSO access.
  
  
  
  This particularly includes the usage of GROUPs
  
  including any options and context-options, where the resulting <exec-
  
  targets> are extracted and checked for their accesibility.  In combina-
  
  tion with the "-s" option this is a quite smart approach to check the
  
  SSH accesibility of the unmodioed target list as supplied at the com-
  
  man line or conogured as GROUP.
  
  
  
  SUBTASKs by keywords are not supported by this version.
  
  
  
  Therefore the output is presented as a table, the input parameters are
  
  limited in comparison to native call of ping.  Anyhow, the TCP/IP
  
  address is listed for additional usage of native ping, when extended
  
  analysis is required.
  
  
  
  The entities will be resolved and accessed as selected by options. The
  
  two methods are "ping" which assures the basic TCP/IP-stack access,
  
  or the combined ssh-access, which performs a "ping" check orst, fol-
  
  lowing an remote call of "echo" by usage of ssh.
  
  
  
  For each successful passed entity the basic ssh access and SSO conog-
  
  uration could be seen as validated and accessible when SSH is included.
  
  
  
Options:
  
  
  
   -h
  
       Print help.
  
  
   -i
  
       Displays the original raw input list of targets after expansion of
  
       GROUPs, the context options are displayed too.
  
  
   -l <remote-user>
  
       The remote user to be taken for ssh tests. Default is current user
  
       id.
  
  
   -m
  
       Output of MACHINE addresses in TERSE("-X") mode only.
  
  
   -n
  
       No checks are performed.
  
  
   -r
  
       Resolves not only "include" of GROUPs, but also SUBGROUPs.
  
  
   -s
  
       Activates additional SSH access test. When SSO is not conogured
  
       properly, a password challange dialog occurs.
  
  
   -t
  
       Output of TCP/IP addresses in TERSE("-X") mode only.
  
  
   -V
  
       Version.
  
  
   -X
  
       Terse output format, eoeects "-V" when set left-of.  When acti-
  
       vated, the output is the resulting list as a simple space seperated
  
       string. In case of pre-checked mode successful checked entities are
  
       lsited only, remaining are suppressed.
  
  
  
Arguments:
  
  
  
   <group/machine-address>
  
       Any target to be checked by host, will be ordinarily ping-ed after
  
       ctys-name-resolution to TCP/IP-address.
  
  
  Exit Values:
  
  
  
     o 0: OK
  
       Result is valid.
  
  
     o 1: NOK:
  
       Erroneous parameters.
  
  
     o 2: NOK:
  
       Missing an environment element like oles or databases.
