   ctys-smbutil [options]


Description:
============

   ctys-dnsutil displays a short list of current available SMB server
   and workstations.


Options:
========


   -d <debug-level>

      Same as ctys.


   -h
      Print help.


   -i
      Show numerical TCP/IP-Address. This is supported in combination
      with "-n" option only without "-X" option.


   -n
      Show TCP/IP-Address as name. This is supported in combination
      with "-i" option only without "-X" option.


   -R <runtime states>

      Restricts a set of multiple results with additional 
      constrains for output.

      Only the possible targets which are operable or actually
      operational are listed. This includes the actual running VM with
      it's hosting PM, and in addition all other operational machines,
      where the current VM is available too. This case is the most
      common for NFS based exec-pools, where a single VM could be
      accessed remotely by a number of PMs. This particularly offers
      the advantage of copyless-migration of online and offline VMs.

      Very handy, and in companion with others probably one 
      of the most important internal top-level-calls for 
      GuestOS-Command-Execution.
      
      <runtime states>=[(REVERSE|R|-),]PING|SSH[,PM|VM]


        REVERSE|R|-:
                  This reverses the resulting set, thus the "not
                  matching" states only will be shown.


        PING[:<packetcnt>[%<timeout>]]:

                  A RUNNING session is simply "ping-ed".

                  Resulting statement of operational mode may result on 
                  applied security policies, but not exclusively on the 
                  state of the running OS's IP-stack.


   -V

      See ctys, version output.


   -X

      See ctys, terse for machine output.
