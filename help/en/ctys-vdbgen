  ctys-vdbgen
  
  
Usage:
  
  
  
  ctys-vdbgen [options] <target-list>
  
  
  
Description:
  
  ctys-vdbgen generates databases of static map-
  
  ping from conoguration oles for usage by ctys-gettarget. This tool itself
  
  is a wrapper for
  
  
  
  "ctys -a ENUMERATE=machine...."
  
  
  
  The output of the ENUMERATE action for a given list is stored into
  
  one ole contained in the given DB-PATH, or default respectively.
  
  
  
  The mapping contains available VMs for a given list of PMs.
  
  
  
  Several oles could be generated as specioc access-groups which could
  
  be selected by parameter for ctys call.
  
  
  
  The content will be used as runtime-decision base for additional selec-
  
  tive evaluation by "ctys -a LIST=MACHINE" call.
  
  
  
  REMARKS:
  
  
  
         1. Multiple-Entries of IP, and/or MAC addresses
  
            All entries are evaluated and checked for matching indexes.
  
            This is for an "IP0" an "eth0" is searched, if missing a warn-
  
            ing is generated. Whereas "eth0" without an IP address will
  
            be accepted.
  
  
  
            The second specioc is the generation of one seperate entry
  
            for each of the resolved IP-MAC pair.
  
  
  
         2. Other Multiple-Entries
  
            The common behaviour in case of multiple entries is to use
  
            the FIRST-ONLY. Even though some tools might present
  
            more than one, it must not be relied on!
  
         3. Whitespaces
  
            Whitespaces are generally no supported. When required within
  
            suboptions the '%' sign has to be used for padding oeld-
  
            separators.
  
  
  
            Anyhow, please avoid them, at least for now!
  
  
  Due to the defaults described in the following subsection for options,
  
  the call
  
  
  
  ctys-vdbgen <host1> <host2> ...
  
  
  leads to the default call
  
  
  
  $-HOME"/bin/ctys -a enumerate=machine,b:"$HOME >"
  
    $-HOME"/.ctys/db/default/enum.fdb <host1> <host2> ...
  
  
  Where the PM plugin by default additionaly checks for the PM conog-
  
  uration which is located in
  
  
  
  /etc/ctys.d/pm.conf
  
  
  For additional information refer to  "ctys-genmconf" .
  
  
  
  A special append-mode is supported for addition of data.  This mode
  
  does a pure concatenation only, not redundancy of added data is tested.
  
  Therefore the user should be aware, when calling append mode, whether
  
  he already updated the data of that node.
  
  
  
  The deletion of data has to be performed manually for now, a simple
  
  ASC-II editor, MS-Excel, or the spreadsheet application of OpenOOEce
  
  could be used for this task.
  
  
  
  The data format is described in the appendix of the ctys manual.
  
  
  
Options:
  
  
  
  The following options are case sensitive, thus are required literally.  If
  
  not printed properly, word-options have 2 leading hyphens '-'+'-'="".
  
  
  
   <same as "ctys -a enumerate=machine,b:<srcpathlst>"
  
       With specioc environment variables for modiocation of the default
  
       search path DEFAULT_ENUM_BASE.
  
  
  
       <srcpathlst>=
  
           ""$-BASEPATHLST:-"$DEFAULT"_ENUM"_BASE""
  
       "$-BASEAPPENDLST:+"%"$BASEAPPENDLST""
  
  
  
       which expands by default to
  
  
  
       "ctys -a enumerate=machine,b:"$DEFAULT"_ENUM"_BASE ..."
  
  
  
       All context options and suboptions will be passed through, so
  
       apply same as for ENUMERATE action.
  
  
   append
  
       This activates the append mode, just appending data to present
  
       fdb or creating a new if missing. The modes append, replace, and
  
       stdio are exclusive and could not be combined.
  
  
  
       This is foreseen for addition of minor changes and avoiding a long
  
       running recollection of each data set from each target.
  
  
   -b
  
       Background mode, refer to common options  [it:optb]"-b" .
  
  
   base=<base-path-list>
  
       A <base-path-list> to be scanned exclusively. This can be com-
  
       bined with multiple targets and the "append" mode for quick
  
       addition of specioc new VMs.  The path could be the contianing
  
       directory for a single VM only.
  
  
   -c
  
       Nameservice caching mode, refer to common options  [it:optc]"-c"
  
       .
  
  
   -C
  
       Result data caching mode, refer to common options [it:optC]"-C"
  
       .
  
  
   cacheDB=<output-db-directory-path>
  
       Pathname for directory containing DB ole to be created. This ole
  
       stores the mapping records generated from ctys-ENUMERATE
  
       literally.
  
  
  
       The evaluation order priority and predeoned default values for the
  
       directory is deoned as follows:
  
  
         1. "cacheDB=<output-db-directory-path>"
  
         2. DEFAULT_VDBGEN_DB=$HOME/.ctys/db/default
  
         3. DEFAULT_DBPATHLST=$HOME/.ctys/db/default
  
  
       or
  
  
         1. "cacheDB=<output-db-directory-path>"
  
         2. DEFAULT_VDBGEN_DB=<install-path>/conf/db/default
  
         3. DEFAULT_DBPATHLST=<install-path>/conf/db/default
  
  
       The name for the oledb itself is hard-coded as "enum.fdb".  Ad-
  
       ditional oles are be stored within the cacheDB directory.
  
  
  
       REMARK:
  
            Only ONE path could be provided here for the PATHLST.
  
  
   olecontext
  
       This switches ooe several defaults and assumes that a conoguration
  
       ole with a complete CONTEXT is provided.
  
  
  
       The explicit suppression of defaults is required, due to the addition
  
       of chained context options for dialogue based entries from right
  
       to left. The evaluation of superposing options is proceeded from-
  
       left-to-right. Thus the last wins, so the last dialogue entries have
  
       the highest priority.
  
  
   progress
  
       This activates the formatted table output, therefore some traces
  
       are oltered and displaye in a compact overview, indicating the
  
       progress and required processing time.
  
  
  
       For the application of the "progress" option additionally the
  
       appropriate trace switches for the target has to be set.  This is
  
       due to the required activation of the appropriate trace output for
  
       post-oltering on local machine.  In case of usage of MACROS or
  
       GROUPS these could be stored permanenetly as required.
  
  
  
       E.g.  the following  [it:optd]debugging("-d")  context options for
  
       the target of enumeration required to be present.
  
  
  
       ctys-vdbgen "
  
          --cacheDB=/home/tstusr/.ctys/db/tmp "
  
          --append "
  
          --base=qemu "
  
          lab00'(-d 2,s:16,w:0,p)'
  
  
  
       When "progress" choosen the data for each displayed instance is
  
       a post-result, calculated as a sumup after onished processing. For
  
       continuous display refer to "progressall".
  
  
  
   progressall
  
       This activates the formatted table output with continuous display,
  
       where the data is oltered as well, but any relevant entity with an
  
       intermidiate result is displayed.  The onal sum-up data is addi-
  
       tionally displayed as soon as the somplete set of results for the
  
       current entity is available.
  
  
  
   replace
  
       This activates the explicit replace mode, which is required when
  
       a "enum.fdb" alread exists. Choosing this will delete the present
  
       "enum.fdb", when the data has to be kept, make a backup before
  
       activating this option. The modes append, replace, and stdio are
  
       exclusive and could not be combined.
  
  
  
   stdio
  
  
  
       Writes it's output to STDOUT only. The modes append, replace,
  
       and stdio are exclusive and could not be combined.
  
  
   -t
  
       Session type, refer to common options  [it:optt]"-t" .
  
  
   -T
  
       Preload of session type plugins, refer to common options [it:optT]"-
  
       T" .
  
  
  
Arguments:
  
  
  
   <target-list>
  
       Any target to be enumerated.
  
  
  Exit Values:
  
  
  
     o 0: OK
  
       Result is valid.
  
  
     o 1: NOK:
  
       Erroneous parameters.
  
  
     o 2: NOK:
  
       Missing an environment element like oles or databases.
