Xen parts for a i386 para-virtualized VM
========================================


This is a minimalistic "native install configuration" example similar 
as described by the CentOS-Wiki: 

   "Creating and istalling a CentOS domU instance"

The target is to setup a bare VM (hopefully) without any difficulties.

PREREQUISITE:

  A running Dom0, which is for CentOS-5x quite straight-forward, and just
  requires:

  1. Running CentOS-Installation
  2. Installed Xen-Kernel, the updates and extras should have
     been applied. Prooven with from-the-box-kernel:

       2.6.18-8.1.15.el5.centos.plusxen

  3. Following packages should have been installed, and is tested with:

     - bridge-utils
     - hotplug-system
     - zlib-devel
     - Python 2.2
     - initscripts
     - xen-3.0.3
     - libvirt
     - virt-manager

   4. Following network services:

      -> DHCP
      -> DNS
      -> NFS
      -> FTP


The installation and setup should require until a running VM about
10-15Minutes, when performed within a Gigabit-LAN on a "Celeron 420S"
running Xen with CentOS-5.0. This includes full installation, reboot,
login into runtime-system and halt runtime-system.



For fully unattended creation of a VM call:

   sh createVM.sh <anchor-file>

   <anchor-file>

      -> tst100.i386.anchor
         Creates VM named tst100 as an i386 32-bit paravirtualized 
         machine.

      -> tst101.x86_64.anchor
         Creates VM named tst101 as an x86_64 64-bit paravirtualized
         machine.
