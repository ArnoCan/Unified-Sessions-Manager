   9.2.2.4. ToDo
    ------------


    1. Frequently fails to attach a viewer to a started server ONCE
       only, when started first time. After this seems to be stable.
       So a following CONNECT or REUSE will attach a vncviewer.

       "X Error of failed request:  \
        BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)"

       Solution, ... (would be deeply welcome!).
