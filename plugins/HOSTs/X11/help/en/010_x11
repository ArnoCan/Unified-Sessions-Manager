   9.2.3. X11 - X11 Server Calls
   =============================

   9.2.3.1. Description
    -------------------

     The X11-plugin starts simply a remote XClient and uses by default
     "DisplayForwarding", or in case of coallocated local execution of
     XClient and XServer "LocalOnly". Currently "ConnectionForwarding"
     is not supported. Also display reflection between remote sites is
     going to be supported in a later version.

     The X11 plugin is mostly the same as the CLI plugin, with some
     minor differences resulting from the detached output from the
     callers terminal/window. Therefore almost any task performed with
     X11 could be performed by the CLI plugin manually.

     So any advantage of using the X11 plugin instead of native ssh
     based calls is the same as for the advantage of CLI compared to
     the direct usage of ssh.




   9.2.3.2. Options
    ---------------

     -a action[=<suboptions>]
 
 
         CREATE
         ======

            CREATE=[<machine-address>]
                   [,<CALLOPTS|C>]
                   [,<XOPTS|X>]
                   [,<SHELL|S>]
                   [,<CMD>]
                   [,<DH>|<SH>]


            <machine-address>

              See standard for syntax.

              The LABEL suboption is here mandatory.



            <CALLOPTS|C>

              See standard.



            <XOPTS|X>
              See standard.



            <SHELL|S>

              Replaces the standard definition of an interactive shell
              by 

                    CLI_SHELL_DEFAULT='bash -i'

              for remote execution.

              When setting an own shell the masking of SPACEs has to
              be applied by "%" in accordance to common ctys cli
              rules.
              The default will be applied on command line interface
              as:

                 ... -a CREATE=c:'bash%-i' ...




            <CMD>

              Replaces the standard definition of an command execution
              shell by 

                    CLI_SHELL_CMD_DEFAULT="bash -c"

              for remote execution.




            <DH>|<SH>

              Sets for internal generated options the required number
              of hyphens. E.g. the recalculated "geometry" option for
              xinerama mode is one candidate for that. This is due to
              the fact, that most legacy X11 applications,
              e.g. xclock, require only one hyphen for geometry
              options, whereas the newer desktop applications like
              gnome-terminal do require double-hyphen options
              prefixes.

              The default will be detected by checking the presence of
              gnome-terminal, which defines DH, else SH will be used
              by default.




         ENUMERATE
         =========
 
            Not applicable to CLI.
 
 
         LIST
         ====

           Almost the same output as common standard, with following
           changes in semantics.


             [id]
               The PID of the local SSH termination point, which is
               the locally executed relay-instance of ctys and is the
               parent shell of actual running batch/interactive shell.


           Exactly the same semantics as common standard:


             label, type, pid, gid, user, group, host, cs


           The following values are not applicable:

             uuid, mac, dsp, cp, sp

           

           List-Output-Format for MACHINE option:
            -------------------------------------

             +-----------------------------+
               0 - h:    host              |
               1 - t:    type
               2 - l:    label             | Structure is 
               3 - i:    id                | identical to ENUMERATE
               4 - uu:   uuid              | action
               5 - mac:  mac               |
             +-----------------------------+
               6 - dsp:  display
               7 - cp:   client access port
               8 - sp:   server access port
               9 - p:    pid
              10 - u:    uid
              11 - g:    gid
              12 - cs:   client|server


               6. Display to be used for X11.
               7. TCP/IP-port for client connect.
               8. Port for server managemetn, e.g. as supported by
                  Xen.


         SUSPEND
         =======
 
            Not applicable to CLI.
 
 
         CANCEL
         ======
 
            Not applicable to CLI.
 


     -L (LocalOnly|LO)
       | (DisplayForwarding|DF)
 
       Even though a DISPLAY will actually not be used, this parameter
       also adopts the behavior of the execution to a providing
       environment, which is frequently for ctys true.

       So these are the only location parameters to be applied.
