Currently no specific installer for a rpm, deb, or any other type of
packages is provided.

The installation is supported by simple archive to be extracted and a
propriatary shell script, which has several options in order to
protect edited configuration files and create shared installations
based on symbolic links. The call is simply 

   "ctys.01_08_001b04/bin/ctys-install <option>"

where option could be for example

   "ctys.01_08_001b02/bin/ctys-install forceclean"


The installation creates the directories:

  $HOME/bin
  $HOME/lib
  $HOME/ctys
  $HOME/.ctys
  $HOME/.vnc

The ".profile" is extended for the PATH variable to include the
"$HOME/bin" directory.

Also the following files are copied:

  $HOME/.toprc

There are from now on several measures required, if not yet in place,
in order to setup QEMU, Xen, and/or VMware, and to install VMs.

Seperate documents are extracted from the User-Manual for installation 
of ctys and specific hypervisors/emulators.
